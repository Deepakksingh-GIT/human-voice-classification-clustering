# human-voice-classification-clustering
A machine learning project for analyzing human voice samples using audio feature extraction, preprocessing, clustering, and classification. Includes model evaluation and a Streamlit app for uploading audio and generating real-time voice-based predictions.

## 🔍 Domain
**Speech Processing, Machine Learning**

## 📌 Problem Statement

Develop a machine learning-based model to classify and cluster human voice samples based on extracted audio features. The system will preprocess the dataset, apply clustering and classification models, and evaluate their performance. A Streamlit application will allow users to upload audio samples and receive predictions.

## 🎯 Business Use Cases

### 1. **Speaker Identification**
Identify individual speakers based on unique voice features.

### 2. **Gender Classification**
Classify voice samples as *male* or *female* for applications such as call center analytics.

### 3. **Speech Analytics**
Extract insights from audio data for industries such as media, security, and customer service.

### 4. **Assistive Technologies**
Improve accessibility by analyzing speech patterns for better interaction systems.
